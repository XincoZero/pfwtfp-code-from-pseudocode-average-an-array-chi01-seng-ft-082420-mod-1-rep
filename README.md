# Code From Pseudocode: Average an Array

## Learning Goals

- Create Code from Pseudocode

## Introduction

You've now had a chance to practice creating pseudocode on your own. Let's
convert that pseudocode into actual Ruby code. You should have your pseudocode
nearby.  We'll show you _our_ pseudocode and you can compare your process to
ours.

### Our Pseudocode

Here's what our pseudocode looks like:

<article id="identify_the_problem">
  <header>
    <h1>Identify the problem</h1>
  </header>
  <section>
    <p class="response">
    We want to find the arithmetic average.
    </p>
  </section>
</article>
<article id="identify_the_output">
  <header>
    <h2>Identify the output that would solve the problem</h2>
  </header>
  <section>
    <p class="response">
    Using the definition of average, calculate the mean defined as the sum
    of the inputs divided by their count
    </p>
  </section>
</article>
<article id="name_the_procedure">
  <header>
    <h2>Name the procedure that fixes the problem</h2>
  </header>
  <section>
    <p class="response">
    average_collection_of_numbers
    </p>
  </section>
</article>
<article id="identify_what_inputs">
  <header>
    <h2>Identify what inputs are needed to create the output</h2>
  </header>
  <section>
    <p class="response">
      <li>Array of numbers</li>
      <li>Count of the numbers</li>
    </p>
  </section>
</article>
<article id="define_the_procedure">
  <header>
    <h2>Define the procedureâ€™s implementation</h2>
  </header>
  <section>
    <!-- You might want to wrap your response in <pre> tags -->
    <p class="response">
    <pre>
      local var: running total
      local var: count
      For each element
        accumulate its value to running total AND
        add a tick to count
      return running total / count
    </p>
  </section>
</article>

## Create Code from Pseudocode

### Steps 1 and 2

Let's get started. The first two activities of the Flatiron Process are not
going to be much help to us in this part of development: "Identify the Problem"
and "Identify the Output." These two steps are used to make sure we're solving
the right problem. They will actually be used at the end, _after_ coding, to
make sure we coded the right Procedure and that it does what planned on it
doing. We'll check on them at the end.

### Step 3: Name the Procedure

We **do** however, want to pick up with "Step 3: Name the Procedure." In our
code buffer, we'll define the method as Ruby requires:

```ruby
def average_collection_of_numbers
end
```

### Step 4: Identify What Inputs are Needed

Our pseudocode suggests:

- Array of numbers
- Count of the numbers

So our Ruby code should look like:


```ruby
def average_collection_of_numbers(array_of_numbers, number_count)
end
```

However this is not typical Ruby style and it'd be surprising, from an
experienced Rubyist to see code like this. We'd expect it to look more like:


```ruby
def average_numbers(collection)
  collection_count = collection.count
end
```

Some taste and experience decisions are shown in how we did this that we would
like to discuss with you.

#### Why not `array_of_numbers`?

We said in our pseudocode that we needed a collection, or `Array` of numbers.
Why not reflect that in the name of the input?

It's a good question. In some languages we would have so specify that the thing
coming in was an `Array` of `Integer` or `Float`. Ruby doesn't require that
from us (although future versions might soon!). Ruby doesn't require this and a
great host of bugs have arisen because of it. Many smart people have come to
think that *not* requiring us to specify what type we expected has been a Bad
Idea.

Given all that, why wouldn't we document, in the most visible possible way,
that we expect an `array_of_numbers`? Well, it's simply not the style in which
Ruby is written. Ruby style suggests that when you add an `s` which makes a
variable name plural, you're signaling to readers that you mean to take a
collection of some sort (usually an `Array`) and _that_ is sufficient. There
*are* other collections which are interchangeable with `Array`s (we won't cover
them here, but you can learn more about them in the Resources section, below).

Furthermore we can restructure the name of the method and the arguments to
contain essentially the same information, but less verbosely:


```ruby
def average_numbers(collection)
```

#### Why Did you Drop the `number_count`

While pseudocoding, it helps to know that our method  depends on knowing on the
count of numbers in our collection. However, this programming language, Ruby,
has an awesome built-in command for finding the number of members in a
collection called `count`. Is there any way that the information we expect to
be passed in would be _different_ from what Ruby calculated? The answer is
clearly "no." So, we can _hide_ that complexity.

Would you rather write (and which is less error-prone?):

```ruby
collection = [1,2,3]
collection_length = collection.count
average_numbers(collection, collection_length)
```

or:

```ruby
collection = [1,2,3]
average_numbers(collection)
```

### Step 5: Define the Procedure

Our final step, which, dangerously, is where many coders leap to _first_ is
the implementation. Let's take the pseudocode and put it inside of our method
that's under progress.

```ruby
def average_numbers(collection)
  collection_count = collection.count
#      local var: running total
#      local var: count
#      For each element
#        accumulate its value to running total AND
#        add a tick to count
#      return running total / count
end
```

First, we'll translate the local variables. We'll define `running_total` and
drop the local variable `count` because that's been calculated already. We can
also remove the pseudocode line where we add to `count`.

```ruby
def average_numbers(collection)
  collection_count = collection.count
  running_total = 0
#      For each element
#        accumulate its value to running total
#      return running total / count
end
```

Next, let's activate our return statement. Ruby automatically "returns" the
last line of code, so it's unusual to see a `return` statement as the last line
of a method in Ruby. The code would look like this.

```ruby
def average_numbers(collection)
  collection_count = collection.count
  running_total = 0
#      For each element
#        accumulate its value to running total 
  running total / count
end
```

Ruby has a vast array (no pun intended) of tools for looping and iteration.
We're going to use a very simple one called `upto`. Since we have the
`collection_count`, let's iterate from 0 to the `count - 1`.

```ruby
def average_numbers(collection)
  collection_count = collection.count
  running_total = 0
  0.upto(collection.count - 1) do |i|
    running_total += collection[i]
  end
  running_total / collection_count
end
```

> **Stretch**: If you're comfortable with this code, an experienced Rubyist
> would probably write this method as:

```ruby
def average_numbers(collection)
  collection.reduce(:&+) / collection.count
end
```

Amazingly, if you explore this code, it performs the _exact same_ pseudocode as
what we wrote earlier. Provided your _logic_, captured in psuedocode, is
correct, it's easy to swap out _implementations_ to more powerful magic as you
grow in experience!

### Verify the Code!

Test the code with `collection` set to `[1,2,3]` and we'll see our code works!

### Lab

...But the code has a bug. It's always worth testing the code with non-obvious
test data. `[1,2,3]`. We should always test our methods with some complex data
once we get the basic case working.

We've given you the code above as a starting point. Use the Triangle Process to
isolate the bug, fix the code, and move on!
